Chapter 0 - Introduction

In 2006, Feoffrey Hinton et al published a paper showing dnn recognizaing handwritten digits w/ state-of-art precision (>98%).

Python frameworks:
1. Sikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org) created in 2007
2. Tensorflow (https://tensorflow.org) created at Google and was open sourced in November 2015, and version 2 released in 2019.
3. Keras (https://keras.io) is a high-level deep learning API. Keras comes with TensoFlow, and it relies on TensorFlow for all the intensive computations.

Chapter 1 - The machine learning landscape

Some ML concepts:
- Data mining: digging into large amounts of data to discover hidden patterns is called data mining, and ml excles at it.
- Target & labels: are generally treated as synonyms in supvervised learning, but target is more common in regression tasks and label is more common in classification tasks.

Type of ML systems:
1) supvervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and others
2) online versus batch learning
3) instace-based vs. model-based learning
e.g. spam filter may learn on the fly using a DNN model trained using human-provised exmaples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, model-based, supervised learning system.

1) 
- supervised learning: calssification & regression
- unsupvervised learning: 
	- clustering
	- visualization (dimensionality reduction, feature extraction)
	- anomaly detection / novelty detection
	- association rule learning
- semi-supervised learning
